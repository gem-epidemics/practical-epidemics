# Practical Epidemics

The Practical Epidemics set of tutorial-style documents is intended to give
those starting out in the analysis of epidemic data some go-to documents
explaining the basics of implementing modelling techniques.  Our topics are
many and varied, from explaining algorithms and methodology, to hints and
tips on computer implementation and visualisation of results.
