The Practical Epidemics set of tutorial-style notebooks on some of the more practical
aspects of implementing epidemic models and fitting (i.e. training or calibrating) them to
data.  In particular, it includes the set of course notes for IDDinf, a week-long
programme on (primarily) MCMC for fitting Bayesian infectious disease models.
