# IDDinf

IDDinf is a short course on likelihood-based inference methods for infectious disease
models hosted at Lancaster University. This hands-on course will provide a comprehensive
introduction to likelihood-based statistical inference methods for stochastic infectious
disease models. You will be introduced to likelihood theory, MCMC methods, and particle
filters through a series of lectures, programming workshops, and epidemic case-studies. On
completion, you will have a deeper understanding of how likelihood-based inference methods
work on infectious disease models, and be able to apply them to your own epidemiological
problems.
