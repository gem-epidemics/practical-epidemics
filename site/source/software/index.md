# Software guides

In this section you will find hints and tips on using various software
environments.  Much of what is discussed is generic, and applicable to
wider subjects than simply epidemics.  If a particular guide particularly
appeals to you, or you wish to contribute a new guide, drop us an issue
in our Gitlab repository!
